# Password Generator
This is a program that generates a customizable complex password for the user. It features:
* Lowercase and uppercase letters;
* Numbers;
* Special characters.
* 6 to 36 characters length
## What have I learned with the project?
Working with randomization and strings, I managed to merge `string` and `random` libraries to create an algorithm to get random types of characters mixed in just a few lines of code.
